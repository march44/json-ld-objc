json-ld-objc
============

An objective-c port of the json-ld api and specification

The initial port is based on the json-ld java [port](https://github.com/jsonld-java/jsonld-java/).

Once the JSON-LD specification has reached 1.0, the project will be refactored
where necessary to better align with objective-c
